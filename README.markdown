## Where Is the *Code* for My EXPER3 2016 Entry?

This repository is just a placeholder.

Historically, I have developed my EXPER3 entries in the open and released all their code and content under a very permissive license here on GitHub. Unfortunately, this year I am choosing to make my game in RPG Maker MV, and I am not confident that the license for that software _allows_ me to release my work as open-source. Every RPG Maker MV project directory contain the entirety of the engine's source code as well as all the default assets that come with the engine. Furthermore, as there is no package manager for RPG Maker MV, the project must include copies of every plugin or library it depends on and every third-party asset it uses. For some of these, while it is clear that distribution as part of a finished game package is allowed, it is not clear whether distribution as part of an open-source project would be.

It is entirely possible that these concerns are unfounded and all of this would be fine or would be fine with the appropriate disclaimers and LICENSE files. But I need to be focusing on my creation rather than legal matters right now, so I will be developing this year's entry as closed-source. I would still like to open-source it someday, if conditions allow, but right now I need to focus on making the game more than releasing it, and trying to open-source it would be a distraction.
